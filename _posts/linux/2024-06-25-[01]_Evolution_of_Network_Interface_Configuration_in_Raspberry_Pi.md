## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi has become a beloved tool for hobbyists, educators, and developers alike. One crucial aspect of working with a Raspberry Pi is configuring its network interface. Over the years, the methods for setting up network interfaces on the Raspberry Pi have evolved significantly. This post will guide you through the historical changes, providing detailed explanations, examples, and insights into the current best practices.

## Legacy Method: `/etc/network/interfaces`

### Overview
In the early days, the primary method to configure network interfaces on the Raspberry Pi was through the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

### Example

```bash
# Static IP configuration for wlan0
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    wpa-ssid "YourNetworkSSID"
    wpa-psk "YourNetworkPassword"
```

### Key Points
- Directly edit the configuration file.
- Simple and straightforward.
- Used for both static and dynamic IP addresses.

## Transition to `dhcpcd.conf`

### Overview
Starting with Raspbian Jessie in 2015, the Raspberry Pi began using `dhcpcd` as the default DHCP client. The configuration moved to `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`.

### Example

```bash
# Static IP configuration for wlan0
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1
```

### Key Points
- Managed by `dhcpcd` service.
- Preferred for its simplicity and flexibility.
- Better handling of dynamic IP configurations.

## Wireless Configuration with `wpa_supplicant`

### Overview
For wireless networks, the `wpa_supplicant` configuration file, located at `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`, is used.

### Example

```bash
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
    ssid="YourNetworkSSID"
    psk="YourNetworkPassword"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

### Key Points
- Essential for Wi-Fi configurations.
- Supports multiple networks and security protocols.
- Can be used alongside `dhcpcd.conf`.

## Adoption of `NetworkManager`

### Overview
Recent versions of Raspbian (now Raspberry Pi OS) have adopted `NetworkManager` as the default tool for network configuration. This allows for more sophisticated and flexible network management.

### Example

#### Using `nmcli`
```bash
# Creating a new connection
nmcli dev wifi connect "YourNetworkSSID" password "YourNetworkPassword"

# Static IP configuration
nmcli connection modify "YourNetworkSSID" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.100/24" ipv4.gateway "192.168.1.1" ipv4.dns "192.168.1.1"
```

#### Configuration File
```ini
# /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/YourNetworkSSID.nmconnection
[connection]
id=YourNetworkSSID
uuid=unique-uuid
type=wifi
interface-name=wlan0

[wifi]
mode=infrastructure
ssid=YourNetworkSSID

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=YourNetworkPassword

[ipv4]
method=manual
addresses1=192.168.1.100/24
gateway=192.168.1.1
dns=192.168.1.1

[ipv6]
method=ignore
```

### Key Points
- Offers a graphical interface and command-line tool (`nmcli`).
- Suitable for both simple and complex network configurations.
- Easily integrates with other network services.

## Using `systemd-networkd`

### Overview
For those who prefer `systemd` for network management, `systemd-networkd` provides a robust alternative.

### Example
```ini
# /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.network
[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.100/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=192.168.1.1
```

### Key Points
- Leverages `systemd`'s powerful and efficient management capabilities.
- Suitable for static and dynamic configurations.
- Ideal for advanced users familiar with `systemd`.

## Conclusion
The evolution of network interface configuration on the Raspberry Pi reflects the broader trends in Linux networking. From the straightforward `interfaces` file to the sophisticated `NetworkManager`, each method offers unique advantages. By understanding these methods, users can better manage their Raspberry Pi's network connections, ensuring robust and reliable connectivity.
