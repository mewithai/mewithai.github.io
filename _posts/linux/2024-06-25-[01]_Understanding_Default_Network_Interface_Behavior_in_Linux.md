# Understanding Default Network Interface Behavior in Linux

When configuring network interfaces on a Linux system, especially in Debian-based distributions, you might notice that interfaces often obtain IP addresses via DHCP even if not explicitly configured to do so. This post delves into why this happens and how network interfaces are managed by default.

## Default DHCP Behavior

In many Linux distributions, including Debian and its derivatives, the default behavior for network interfaces is to attempt to configure via DHCP if no specific configuration is provided. This behavior is influenced by the system's networking services and management tools.

### Debian-based Systems

On Debian-based systems, if an interface is configured with the `iface inet manual` option without specifying a static IP or disabling DHCP explicitly, it might still acquire an IP address via DHCP. This is due to default network management tools like `NetworkManager` or the `dhclient` utility which are often configured to manage interfaces dynamically.

### NetworkManager

**NetworkManager** is a widely used network management tool that handles network interfaces dynamically. If NetworkManager is enabled, it will typically attempt to configure any network interface that doesn't have a specific static IP configuration by requesting an IP address from a DHCP server.

### Dynamic Configuration Protocols

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** allows interfaces to obtain IP addresses and other network configuration details automatically. This is often the default protocol for network interfaces to ensure they can connect to the network seamlessly without manual intervention.

## Example of Interface Configuration

In the `/etc/network/interfaces` file, if an interface is configured without specifying `dhcp` or `static` options, tools like NetworkManager may still handle it by trying to configure it using DHCP:

```plaintext
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual
```

Despite the `manual` method, if no explicit static configuration is provided, and NetworkManager is active, it can request an IP via DHCP for `eth0`.

## Summary

The default behavior of obtaining an IP address via DHCP when no specific configuration is provided is influenced by the network management tools and services active on the system. NetworkManager and similar tools are designed to manage interfaces dynamically, ensuring they get configured for network access even if the configuration files don't explicitly define a DHCP setup.
